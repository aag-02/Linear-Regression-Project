# Linear-Regression-Project

### Project Overview
This project applies Linear Regression techniques to predict housing prices. The primary objective is to demonstrate the effective use of statistical and machine learning methodologies/principles to derive accurate predictions from a set dataset. The scope of this project strictly involves implementing and fine-tuning a linear regression model to forecast housing prices.

### Focus of the Project
This project is solely focused on the application of Linear Regression. It does not cover data acquisition or data cleaning processes. The dataset used here has been pre-processed and cleaned ahead of time to ensure that I can focus exclusively on the modeling aspects.

### Why Skip Data Acquisition and Cleaning?
The intent of bypassing the data acquisition and cleaning stages is to concentrate on the core statistical techniques and the implementation of the linear regression model. For those interested in assessing my skills related to data gathering and cleaning, other projects in my portfolio that include these aspects are available and demonstrate these competencies.

### Model Description
Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical approach in machine learning, which predicts a response using a linear combination of input features. This project employs this method to predict housing prices based on various attributes of the houses.

### Features and Predictor


### Repository Structure
README.md - This document, describing the project.
data/ - Folder containing the pre-processed dataset used for modeling (Note: Data is assumed to be clean and ready for use).
notebooks/ - Jupyter notebooks with the detailed step-by-step analysis of the model.
results/ - Folder storing output results and any graphs generated as part of the analysis.

### Model Performance
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others. These metrics help in understanding how well the model is able to predict housing prices relative to the actual market prices.
